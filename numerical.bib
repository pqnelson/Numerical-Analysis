abstract = {This paper presents the statistical results of tests of the accuracy of certain arithmetic
systems in evaluating sums, products and inner products, and analytic error estimates
for some of the computations. The arithmetic systems studied are 6-digit hexadecimal
and 22-digit binary floating point number representations combined with the usual
chop and round modes of arithmetic with various numbers of guard digits, and with
a modified round mode with guard digits. In a certain sense, arithmetic systems differing
only in their use of binary or hexadecimal number representations are shown to be
approximately statistically equivalent in accuracy. Further, the usual round mode
with guard digits is shown to be statistically superior in accuracy to the usual chop
mode in all cases save one. The modified round mode is found to be superior to the
chop mode in all cases.},
