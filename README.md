This is just my collated notes on numerical analysis, mostly based on UC
Davis Math 128A/B/C. I've also supplemented them with summaries from
other articles and books. I'm working my way through integrating my
notes into my Zettelkasten, and then using the Zettels to write these
notes. Hence my writing is rather slow.

The code is written in Fortran, because that seems like the _lingua franca_
for numerical analysis
(contrary to the wishes of the Julia community).
