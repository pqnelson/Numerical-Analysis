\section{References}

References for floating-point seem to boil down to the
\emph{Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic}~\cite{10.5555/3235984},
Knuth~\cite{taocp2}, and the second chapter of Higham~\cite{higham2002}.
I found Trefethen and Bau~\cite{trefethen1997numerical} instructive,
they are the source of ``idealized floating-point'' (although they do
not use that name).

There is a rich literature on floating-point to be plumbed by any
student of numerical analysis: Kahan~\cite{kahan1973}, Wilkinson's
``Old Testament''~\cite{wilkinson1965} and ``New Testament''~\cite{wilkinson1963},
among many others.
